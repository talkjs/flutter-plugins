# webview\_flutter\_wkwebview

The Apple WKWebView implementation of [`webview_flutter`][1].

# IMPORTANT

This is a fork of [webview_flutter_wkwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter_wkwebview).
The changes made are specific to the [TalkJS Flutter SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/talkjs_flutter)
and hence this package is NOT intended for use with other packages/plugins.

The versioning of this plugin is kept in sync with the main plugin it was forked from.

## Usage

This package is [endorsed][2], which means you can simply use `webview_flutter`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do.
