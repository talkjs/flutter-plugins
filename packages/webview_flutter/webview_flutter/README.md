# WebView for TalkJS Flutter SDK

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/webview_flutter.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter)

A Flutter plugin that provides a WebView widget.

# IMPORTANT

This is a fork that depends on [talkjs_webview_flutter_android](https://pub.dev/packages/talkjs_webview_flutter_android).
which provides file upload support to the Android implementation of the WebView. The changes made are specific to the
[TalkJS Flutter SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/talkjs_flutter) and hence this package is NOT intended for use with other
packages/plugins. Aside from the changes mentioned, no other changes have been made to this package.
This is merely a stopgap measure until this [Pull Request](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/pull/5172)
is merged into the main repository.

On iOS the WebView widget is backed by a [WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview);
On Android the WebView widget is backed by a [WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView).

|             | Android        | iOS  |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---- |
| **Support** | SDK 19+ or 20+ | 9.0+ |

## Usage

Add `talkjs_webview_flutter` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels). If you are targeting Android, make sure to read the _Android Platform Views_ section below to choose the platform view mode that best suits your needs.

You can now include a WebView widget in your widget tree. See the
[WebView](https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/latest/webview_flutter/WebView-class.html)
widget's Dartdoc for more details on how to use the widget.

## Android Platform Views

This plugin uses
[Platform Views](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-views) to embed
the Androidâ€™s webview within the Flutter app. It supports two modes:
_hybrid composition_ (the current default) and _virtual display_.

Here are some points to consider when choosing between the two:

- _Hybrid composition_ has built-in keyboard support while _virtual display_ has multiple
  [keyboard issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Avd-only+label%3A%22p%3A+webview-keyboard%22).
- _Hybrid composition_ requires Android SDK 19+ while _virtual display_ requires Android SDK 20+.
- _Hybrid composition_ and _virtual display_ have different
  [performance tradeoffs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-views#performance).

### Using Hybrid Composition

The mode is currently enabled by default. You should however make sure to set the correct `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` if it was previously lower than 19:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 19
    }
}
```

### Using Virtual displays

1. Set the correct `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle` (if it was previously lower than 20):

   ```groovy
   android {
       defaultConfig {
           minSdkVersion 20
       }
   }
   ```

2. Set `WebView.platform = AndroidWebView();` in `initState()`.
   For example:

   ```dart
   import 'dart:io';

   import 'package:talkjs_webview_flutter/webview_flutter.dart';

   class WebViewExample extends StatefulWidget {
     @override
     WebViewExampleState createState() => WebViewExampleState();
   }

   class WebViewExampleState extends State<WebViewExample> {
     @override
     void initState() {
       super.initState();
       // Enable virtual display.
       if (Platform.isAndroid) WebView.platform = AndroidWebView();
     }

     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return WebView(
         initialUrl: 'https://flutter.dev',
       );
     }
   }
   ```

### Enable Material Components for Android

To use Material Components when the user interacts with input elements in the WebView,
follow the steps described in the [Enabling Material Components instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#enabling-material-components).

### Setting custom headers on POST requests

Currently, setting custom headers when making a post request with the WebViewController's `loadRequest` method is not supported on Android.
If you require this functionality, a workaround is to make the request manually, and then load the response data using `loadHTMLString` instead.
